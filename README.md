## 🎓 - Nota Bene

This project has been realized within the framework of the *Basics of Object Oriented Programming - C++* course. Due to a lack of time, I was forced to rush the project but I have a taste of unfinished business. That's why I'm here, I'd like to be able to polish this project properly and why not add some features! Apart from that, it's the first time I'm posting on GitHub so I don't really master the codes but the simple fact that you've read this far makes me quite happy, don't hesitate to give me feedback on my code, I'm here to learn as much as possible.
